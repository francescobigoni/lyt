# Examples
This directory contains example *Lyt* applications. To run an example, make sure that *Lyt* is installed and that `lyt` is in your path, then run for example:

```
$ cd test_tone
$ lyt run test_tone.cpp
```

All of the examples are:

* `echo` --- Shows the use of the `Delay` class to create an echo effect.
* `test_tone` --- Shows the basic use of the `Buffer` class and the `mapt` function.
* `two_tones` --- Show the use of the `append` function of the `Buffer` class.

Each example will write a output file called `output.wav`
